# Bridget's Personal Website

Hi everyone, I have never attempted to dive into the world of front-end development, so I thought I would give it a try. It has been a lot of fun so far!

So far I have created a very bare interface and an About Me section.

I plan on getting all the contents in the page, then I will work on the aesthetics.
